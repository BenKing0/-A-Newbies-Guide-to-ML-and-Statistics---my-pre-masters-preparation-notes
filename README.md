# A Newbies Guide to ML and Statistics - my pre-masters preparation notes

Notes that I made on machine learning and statistics in order to apply to CSML based master's courses. This covers some mathematical grounding for a few of the core algorithms in ML. At some point I may update the notes with new content, such as mathematics of SVMs, Reinforcement learning algorithms, stochastic differential equations for options pricing, and encoding algorithms for graphical features.
